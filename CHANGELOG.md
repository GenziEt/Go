## 0.3.6 — Post & confession workflow audit

- Moderation: `cp` no longer bans on "epic party"/"public park" (whole-word matching); link allow-list works for https:// URLs; t.me links need ALLOWED_TELEGRAM_HANDLES; URL shorteners removed; "bomb"/"hatred"/"ማስመሰል" false positives fixed.
- Blocked/restricted users are now stopped for the whole bot (new guard middleware), not only confessions.
- Post wizard: atomic publish claim (no double posts), stale-button checks, HTML previews (no Markdown parse failures), real media previews, /cancel, /drafts + resume, 30-min session expiry, private-chat only, hashtags become tags, long posts split to fit Telegram limits.
- Quarantine: bot posts and confessions now reach the moderator queue and the user is told; Mini App quarantined posts approve into the original post (media/slug preserved); moderators can approve confessions; authors are notified.
- Confessions: collision-free numbering (max+1 under lock), single shared publish path, API publish reports failures, vote switching + live channel counts, removal deletes the channel message.
- Mini App uploads send real photos/videos and accept valid file ids.

## v0.3.5 — Pre-Deployment Hardening
- Added `.dockerignore` (mirroring `.gitignore`: `.env`, `*.db`, `node_modules`, `dist`, `.git`). The Dockerfile's `COPY apps ./apps` had no ignore file, so any `.env`, SQLite database, or `node_modules` a developer happened to have inside `apps/` at build time would be baked into the image layers — extractable by anyone who can pull the image, even from a private registry.
- No paid APIs or services added.

## v0.3.4 — Moderator Security & Content Coverage
- Closed moderator-identity spoofing: report resolution and submission moderation actions now require a verified per-moderator session (`/moderatorlogin` in the bot → one-time code → `X-Moderator-Session` token), not just the shared admin API key plus a client-supplied header.
- Added `/promote` and `/demote` bot commands (OWNER-only) so moderators can actually be added without a manual database edit.
- `/api/media/:fileId` now requires a valid Telegram WebApp session — no longer an unauthenticated open proxy.
- Community, event, opportunity, poll, and quiz creation now run through the same content-moderation pipeline as posts/comments/DMs/confessions (new shared `enforceContentModeration` helper), instead of publishing instantly and unfiltered.
- Fixed the rate limiter to stop trusting a client-supplied `X-Forwarded-For` header unconditionally; it now only reflects a forwarded address when `TRUST_PROXY=true` and Express's own trust-proxy resolution says so, closing a rate-limit bypass.
- Admin panel updated: moderator Telegram-ID field replaced with a one-time-code verification flow.
- No paid APIs or services added.

## v0.3.3 — Confessions & Fixes
- Implemented the anonymous Confessions flow end-to-end: capture → moderation → preview/confirm → anonymous channel publication with sequential confession numbers and reaction-vote buttons (Approach / Forget it / Ask a friend / Stay single).
- Added Confession and ConfessionReaction Prisma models (SQLite and PostgreSQL schemas).
- Generalized ConversationSession to support either a post submission or a confession, so the post-creation flow and the confession flow no longer collide.
- Fixed a critical bug where every direct message was silently rejected: the safety check referenced a non-existent `action` field instead of `decision` and was missing its required `isAdmin` argument, so `POST /api/messages/:userId` always returned "message not sent" while nothing was actually saved. Direct messages now moderate correctly, with the same escalation (repeated-violation restriction, ban on hard violations) used elsewhere.
- No paid APIs or services added.

## v0.3.2 — Real-Time Social Experience
- Added zero-cost Server-Sent Events realtime transport.

- No paid realtime service or external SaaS dependency.
